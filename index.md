### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
<Directory "/var/www/html/protected">
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Authentication Required"
  AuthUserFile "/etc/htpasswd/.htpasswd"
  Require valid-user

  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/serhanbalci/serhanbalci.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
